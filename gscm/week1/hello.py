# This is the first time that I try python
# A variable is a container where I can put content in to it
firstname = "Collin" # for text we use double quotes, text = string
familyname = "Van der Vorst"
# O: Hello Collin Van der Vorst
print("HELLO " + firstname + " " + familyname) #concatenation
firstname = "Lisa"
print("HELLO " + firstname + " " + familyname) #concatenation
